//! The crate provides primitives for manipulating colours in sRGB colour space.
//! Specifically, it provides functions for converting between sRGB space,
//! linear sRGB space and XYZ colour space; as well as exposes the definition of
//! D65 reference white point as well as XYZ colour conversion matrices.
//!
//! The crate intents to provide low-level primitives needed to work with sRGB
//! colour space.  Those primitives can be used by other libraries which need to
//! convert between sRGB and other colour spaces (if the conversion requires
//! going through XYZ colour space) or blend colours together (which requires
//! performing gamma correction).
//!
//! Functions provided in the main module implement conversions between sRGB and
//! XYZ colour spaces while providing routines for intermediate conversions.
//! Functions in [`gamma`] submodule provide functions for doing gamma
//! compression and expansion; they operate on a single colour component.
//! Lastly, [`xyz`] submodule provides functions for converting between linear
//! sRGB and XYZ colour spaces as well as constants exposing the matrices used
//! by those functions.
